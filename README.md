# Programming Language Project

This is an assignment from **CS308: Programming Languages** course, Spring 2022, Fulbright University Vietnam. This course is taught by Dr. Nanette Simenas. 

The purpose of this assignment is to study one programming language of choice, and I choose is **JavaScript**.

## 1. Tutorials

4. Loops and Subroutines
5. Objects and Classes


## 2. Final project

Play the game at https://anh-nguyen-98.github.io/game/

The project is a 2D fighting game between two players. For technical simplicity, the players will use the same keyboard to fight against each other in a game.

One player plays Wizard, the other plays Demon.

Each character can make 4 actions: left - right - jump - attack by using the key set **A - D - W - Space** for **Wizard** and **ArrowLeft - ArrowRight - ArrowUp - ArrowDown** for **Demon**.

During the game, each player is kept track of score, blood, and number of lives. At the beginning of the game, the score of each character is zero, the blood is full, and each character has three lives.

Whenever one player gets attacked, their blood decreases, while the other player gets a score increase. Every time a player runs out of one blood bar, they lose one life. If one player loses three lives, the game is over and the other player wins.
